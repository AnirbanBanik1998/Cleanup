# Cleanup

### A repository to clean up space by deleting unused and less important files

This program helps removing those files which have not been in use over a long time, thereby cleaning up space.

## Requirements:

* Python3

## Steps

* Clone the repository.
* Go to the cloned folder.
* Run **python3 clean_gui.py** to start the GUI.
* Give the path name as any path which you require to scan for cleanup.

The program is still under development...so any kind of contributions are welcome.

### Happy Coding
